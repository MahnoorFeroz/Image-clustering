Project description:
    Clustering is a process of dividing large number of data points into a groups so that data points in one group is similar 
    to each other than those in different groups. The clustering process may be a supervised process using human intervention, 
    or an unsupervised process.

Main purpose:
     Suppose we have large number of different types of images are placed in one folder. Now our main goal is to divide them  
     on the bases of their shapes present in each image. 
  
Objectives:
     1.  Use unsupervised process of clustering.
     
Approach:
    1. Using Python libraries to extract features from images.
    2. Make clusters of the images using features as a base.
